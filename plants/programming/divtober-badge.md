#  Divtober
A few days ago I stumbled into <a href="https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic" target="_blank">Lynn Fishers's</a> post about divtober. The challenge is to
create an illustration with a single div and CSS only. Each day of October has a different topic/subject. You can read more about it on [the event's page](https://a.singlediv.com/divtober2022/).
I've decided to challenge myself, and give it a try. Hopefully, I'll manage to complete all the tasks. You can see some of people's works from this and previous 
years, if you follow the "divtober" hashtag on Twitter. I think it's a great way to test and hone your
CSS skills, and what's more important, to have some fun. 

Here's my first illustration, "Badge" - <a href="https://codepen.io/dzajew/pen/oNddZbG" target="_blank">https://codepen.io/dzajew/pen/oNddZbG</a>.
And a second one, "Dry" - <a href="https://codepen.io/dzajew/pen/ExLLXgq" target="_blank">https://codepen.io/dzajew/pen/ExLLXgq</a>.
