# Stages of Growth

Having a Digital garden means learning in public. Not all things you publish are polished. Some have rough edges, others are only starting to take shape. Very often people have different ways of categorising entries.

For a quite few months, since I decided to go with a garden/wiki like structure on my site, I didn't have any such thing. I couldn't come up with anything, so I decided to borrow some, all, categories from [Simon Dann](https://photogabble.co.uk/glossary/growth/), and [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). For now, they'll suffice, but I think I'll have to come with something of my own. When it will be, I don't know.

Currently there are three categories:
- ðŸŒ± **Seedling**- something just popped into my head. I don't know how it'll end
- ðŸŒ¿ **Budding** - more mature things. I know, more or less, where I want to go with this. I still don't know how it'll end.
- ðŸŒ³ **Evergreen** - I hope it's the end of my tinkering with a given work or idea. Probably it isn't, but it's less likely to change
